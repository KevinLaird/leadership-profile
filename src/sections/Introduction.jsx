            As a leader, I guide with collaboration, effective communication,
            continuous learning, and the well-being of my team in mind. Valuing
            empathy, fun, and stability, I create a predictable and engaging
            environment where everyone feels safe and comfortable to contribute
            their skills to the team. My purpose is to connect people together
            to create a space that is filled with compassion and empathy by
            being an effective communicator and a patient leader.
